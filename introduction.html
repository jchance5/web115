		  <li><strong>Personal background</strong>: I am Joshua Chance, but I go by Josh. I am 22 years old and I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. I enjoy playing video games, going out to hang with friends, and traveling.</li>
		  <li><strong>Professional Background</strong>: Right now, I currently work at Amazon and I also work for a temp agency at a warehouse where I can make my own schedule. I used to work at Sonic Drive-In and Valvoline Instant Oil Change.</li>
		  <li><strong>Academic Background</strong>: I graduated Independence High School in 2019 and is currently pursuing a career in Information Technology.</li>
		  <li><strong>Background in this subject</strong>: I honestly had an interest in computers. I even took a couple of computer classes in middle school as part of electives and sometimes for fun I would play computer games. My mom’s friend and cousin of ours are both in the IT business and I plan on getting into the business right when I finish CPCC.</li>
		  <li><strong>Primary computer platform</strong>: I have a samsung chromebook and a windows 10 family computer.</li>
		  <li><strong>Courses I'm in & Why</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li>WEB115 - Web Markup & Scripting - Part of a prerequisite for one of my classes left on my progress but I look forward to learning more about this class.</li>
			<li>CSC151 - Java Programming - One of the major requirements for Information Technology and I’m also retaking it because I didn’t do too well last summer but it is a very interesting course that I am trying to learn more about.</li>
		</ul>
		  <li><strong>Funny/interesting item about yourself</strong>: I used to play the trumpet in my band class in middle school.</li>
		  <li><strong>Something else I’d also like to share</strong>: I’m just someone who is trying to succeed in life with positive things coming my way.</li>
